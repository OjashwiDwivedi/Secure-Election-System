### Introduction
E-voting systems require heightened security to ensure availability to voters while safeguarding against outside interference. Blockchain technology offers a solution by providing a decentralized and tamper-resistant system.

### Blockchain
Blockchain, introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto, is a peer-to-peer payment system that facilitates cash transactions over the Internet without relying on trust or financial institutions. It consists of ordered data blocks linked together, providing immutability, durability, and a verifiable audit trail.

### Proposed System
The proposed system emphasizes authentication, anonymity, accuracy, and verifiability in the voting process. It leverages Blockchain's decentralized nature to ensure security and prevent tampering.

### Conclusion
The paper concludes by highlighting the advantages of using Blockchain for electronic voting, including public verifiability and resistance to corruption.

## 2. Implementation of Blockchain in E-voting System
### About Application
The application allows voters to cast votes for political parties using their Voter ID. Each voter can vote only once, and the voted information is stored on the Blockchain, ensuring immutability and permanence.

### Structure of Blockchain
The Blockchain consists of blocks containing transactions, each linked to the previous block by a hash. The data stored in each block is protected from tampering using cryptographic hash functions.

### Chaining the Blocks
Blocks are chained together by including the hash of the previous block in each block's data. This ensures that any change in a block invalidates all subsequent blocks, maintaining the integrity of the chain.

### Blockchain Proof of Work
Proof of Work (PoW) is employed to confirm transactions and create new blocks in the chain. Miners compete to solve computationally intensive puzzles, with successful miners being rewarded.

### Adding Blocks to the Chain
Blocks are added to the chain after verification of their contents and the correctness of the Proof of Work. This ensures that only valid and verified transactions are recorded on the Blockchain.

### Mining
Mining involves the process of adding transactions to the Blockchain by solving cryptographic puzzles. Once a block is successfully mined, it is added to the chain, and all nodes in the network update their copies of the chain.

## 3. Instructions to Run Application
1. Clone the project.
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Start a blockchain node server using `export FLASK_APP=service.py` followed by `flask run --port 8000` or `python3 -m flask run --port 8000`.
4. Run the application using `python app.py`. Access the application at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).
